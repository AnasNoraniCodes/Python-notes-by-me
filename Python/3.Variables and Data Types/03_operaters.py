#Operaters in Python

#Arithematic Operaters
# -,+./,* these are arithematic operaters

a = 1
b = 3

use_of_operater = a-b #Here,we used "-" operater
print(use_of_operater)

a = 1
b = 3

use_of_operater = a+b #Here,we used "+" operater
print(use_of_operater)

a = 1
b = 3

use_of_operater = a/b #Here,we used "/" operater
print(use_of_operater)

a = 1
b = 3

use_of_operater = a*b #Here,we used "*" operater
print(use_of_operater)

#Assignment Operaters
# =,+=,-=,*=,/= these are assignment operaters
#these are used to assign a value to variables

a = 2  # here , we assign 2 to a using '=' .
a += 2 # here , we incrememt the values of a and then assign it

#-=,+= are used to increment or decrement the value of variables

#Comparision Operaters 
#<,>,<=,>=,==,!= these are comparision operaters

a = 4<5 #returns True as 4 is less than 5
print(a)
a = 5 >= 5 # returns True as it applies "or" .
print(a)
a= 5==6 #used to check...is it equal ?
print(a)
a= 5 != 6 #returns True as "!" is not .
print(a)

#Logical Operaters
#Used to check conditions
# and,or,not are the logical operaters

a = True or False #if one is true than it returns True
print(a)
a = True and False #if both are true than it returns True
print(a)

print(not(True))   #returns false as it not true is false...
