#Strings are data type in python
#Strings are the sequence of characters enclosed in qoutes

#Here are 3 ways to define strings
#we can use sigle , double , triple quotes for strings

name1 = 'Anas'
name2 = "Anas"
list_of_names = '''
      Anas
      Ahsan
      Jimmy 
      etc
'''

print(name1)
print(name2)
print(list_of_names)

# Here are some rules like predefined index of strings and silence of strings
# we can not change the existing string but can short it(slicing) using index rules
# Positive slicings
name = 'Anas' #The index of A is 0 and the index of n is 1 and so on...
short_name = name[0:3] # sting_name[starting_index(index included) : ending_index (index not included)] 

print(short_name)
